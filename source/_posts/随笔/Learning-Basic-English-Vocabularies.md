## Why did I want to learn vocabularies?

I've been learning English for two months. Although I had learned English in my student days, I forgot all of it after working for a few years. Now, I want to learn it again. In my learning time, I think of remembering vocabulary is the biggest problem for me. Neither the programmer nor the pronounce is hard for me. But when I reading an English book or an English webpage, I find that I don't know the words about 20% in the article. That let reading be an ordeal for me. I need to keep checking the dictionary and that let my reading speed very slowly.

I know learning vocabulary is a long work, but I can learn more basic vocabularies to quickly improve my reading level at beginning. The following are some frequently used vocabularies.

All of the above are all of the basic vocabulary you should learn. The most important category is the Verbs and the Prepositions. We can't only remember the base means of the words. We must deep into it through some dictionaries.
Before we learn more complex vocabularies, we can always use these simple words to replace the complex words.

 The Nouns aren’t very important for us. You don't have to remember many of them at the beginning. Not knowing how to say a thing in English, you can find a dictionary and check it. The more you use more you remember.
